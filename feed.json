I use this tool to diagram whatever crazy technology ideas my boss wanted me to put together for work. I did this a lot. Too much. In fact I think. Somehow a part of me thought it would be a good idea to do this for my relationship as well.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://engagement.wonder-tag.online/media/posts/1/wedding_ring.drawio-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1889\" height=\"1112\"></figure>\n<p>Looks complicated, right?
