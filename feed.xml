                <h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>At work I have to create infrastructure diagrams with something called "draw.io". I use this tool to diagram whatever crazy technology ideas my boss wanted me to put together for work. I did this a lot. Too much. In fact I think. Somehow a part of me thought it would be a good idea to do this for my relationship as well.</p>

<p>Looks complicated, right? Actually it's not. It's a very linear path where one thing leads to another, but we sprinkled "technology" on it so it seems like it's magic :)</p>
